# Prioritizating Ceres Components
Weâ€™re using a scored prioritization framework for products (features) to help determine our development roadmap.

This is not in contrast to the success spectrum earlier developed, but helps support our team in implementation of our development plans in a manner that will drive the most value to users while the solution is being developed, while making the best use of resources.


## Framework
The scoring framework is found below. All metrics are scored on a scale of 0 - 3. An exception is made for dependencies - where the scoring metric scale is 0, 1, 2 and 10.

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
   <td></td>
   <td><strong>0</strong></td>
   <td><strong>1</strong></td>
   <td><strong>2</strong></td>
   <td><strong>3</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Impact</td>
   <td>No impact</td>
   <td>Some impact</td>
   <td>Significant impact</td>
   <td>Radical impact</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Users</td>
   <td>No users</td>
   <td>Less than 30%</td>
   <td>Btw 30 & 70%</td>
   <td>Over 70%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Dependent Apps</td>
   <td>No apps</td>
   <td>Only 1 app</td>
   <td>>=2 apps</td>
   <td>All apps 
   (score of 10 assigned)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Cost</td>
   <td>Significant cost</td>
   <td>Some cost</td>
   <td>Low cost</td>
   <td>No cost</td>
  </tr>
</table>

  </tr>
  <tr>

      <strong>Impact</strong><br>

## Results
Based on this, our order of development would be:
1. Storage tool
2. External data tool
3. Upload tool
4. Entry and Analysis tools

**For this project, we focused on building the alpha prototype of the storage tool, and hope that future development will build out the other components of the Ceres service.**
